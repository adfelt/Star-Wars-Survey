    "While waiting for Star Wars: The Force Awakens to come out, the team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans. In particular, they wondered: does the rest of America realize that **“The Empire Strikes Back”** is clearly the best of the bunch?\n",

    "In order to address these questions FiveThirtyEight sent out a survey and recieved 835 total responses. \n",

    "I will be analyzing those responses and hopefully drawing some useful insights about people's opinions of the Star Wars saga."
